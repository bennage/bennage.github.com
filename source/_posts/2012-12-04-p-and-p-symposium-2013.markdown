Our annual (or mostly annual) conference is coming up in Janaury. I'm _really_ excited about our set of speakers. Including:

* [Adam Steltzner](https://twitter.com/steltzner) from NASA's [Mars Curiosity](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/).
* [Felicity Aston](http://www.felicityaston.co.uk/) the first woman in the world to ski across Antarctica alone.
