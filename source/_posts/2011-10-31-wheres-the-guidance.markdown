First a confession, I really didn't know much about [p&p](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/practices/default.aspx "patterns & practices") before I joined them. I knew that they (or now we) had produced [Unity](http://unity.codeplex.com/). I'd used it on a project or two before coming to Microsoft. I knew we had produced [Prism](http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/) because [Rob](http://www.bluespire.com/ "my former business partner") was on the advisory board. (I _had_ studied Jeremy Miller's [Build Your Own CAB series](http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/2007/07/26/the-build-your-own-cab-series-table-of-contents/) but somehow it didn't stick that it was related to p&p.) I knew vaguely about [EntLib]("http://entlib.codeplex.com/") but most of my knowledge about it was drawn from an MSDN article circa 2005. To put it bluntly, I was ignorant about the group's history.

You see, I ended up in p&p because one night after a user group meeting in Orlando, where Rob and I presented on the development of [Silver Arcade](http://www.silverarcade.com/ "want to buy it?"), I ended up hanging out with [Scott Densmore](http://scottdensmore.typepad.com/). Scott's an unexpected protean blend of 'softie and fanboi Apple. (In a bit of [timely irony](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/dddcqrs/uIkQ6H7J6i4/overview), I believe we spent most of the time post-meeting talking about [CQRS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CQRS) that night.) Scott expressed values about software craftsmanship, agility, open source, and other things that resonated with me. He works in p&p.

I had an interview with [Bob Brumfield](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bobbrum/). I asked what
