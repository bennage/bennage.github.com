I'm two weeks shy of six months at Microsoft. When I arrived here I was immediately thrown into the fray on [Project Silk](http://silk.codeplex.com/). The primary developer on the project was heading into paternity leave. Fortunately, I had read [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742) on my flight out to Redmond. <!-- more -->(I had no idea that I'd be diving deep into JavaScript.)

After Silk, I um, got to work on some other [cool](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/CanvasPaint-6ebde109 "a sample app using a lot of HTML5 goodies") [stuff](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464930 "a primer for async programming patterns in JavaScript") that propelled me even deeper in the HTML5/JavaScript world.

After hours, I started playing with NodeJS. Specifically, spiking out some play-by-post dorky goodness inspired by the efforts of my buddy [Drew Miller](http://anglicangeek.com/ "Anglo-Catholic Christian, RPG dork, and software craftsman") using [Express](http://expressjs.com/ "sort of like Sinatra on Node"), [Mongo](http://www.mongodb.org/ "but I still like RavenDB"), and [Expresso](http://visionmedia.github.com/expresso/ "a unit testing framework for Node").

I've really enjoyed jumping back deep into JavaScript. This is a return for me in many ways. Back in the late 90s I was doing classic ASP development and I had settled on JScript over VBScript. (I had even begun writing an [ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping "object-relational mapper") in JScript, though I had no idea what an ORM was or just how deep the water can get. I just knew that I was tired of writing the same thing over and over.) I was also spending a lot of time with Flash and ActionScript back then. In fact, the Flash community was were I first encountered the MVC pattern. It was also the place where I first began learning about object-oriented programming.

Working at Microsoft has been a wonderful experience so far and I'm especially fond of my team here at [p&p](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/practices/default.aspx "patterns & practices"). It is a different perspective being on the inside. I'm excited about the opportunities to produce quality guidance. I'm also glad to help encourage trends here that I believe are helpful both to the company and the community.

 As a bonus, these first six months here in Redmond have been beautiful weather.

 My next project is exploring the mobile web. This is a crazy, active, and vibrant area at the moment. There's a lot for me to learn. Fortunately, we value transparency here in p&p and I intend to post frequently about my projects.
