I've found recently that I favor blocks over playsets. If we're talking about toys, then of course the canonical example of blocks is Legos. You can build nearly anything with them. They are useful, vertasile, and inviting. 
Now, the term 'playset' might be a little more ambiguous. I don't mean the large outdoor sets with swings and sandboxes and spring-loaded horsies. No, I'm a child of the 80s and I loved me some Star Wars playsets.

So my definition of 'playset' is colored by my childhood. I think think of 'playset' as a themed toy representing an enviroment. Like the Hoth playset pictured here. If you want to pretend you are the Imperials raining destruction upon a ragtag Rebel Alliance, the [Hoth Imperial Attack playset](http://www.ebay.com/csc/i.html?_nkw=Hoth+imperial+attack+playset&LH_Complete=1&_odkw=Hoth+attack+playset "Yes, I had this as a kid.") can't be beat.

The problem is that's all you can do with it. I mean, you can't use it to stage a Cybertronian battle between Optimus and Megatron. (Well you can, but you'll have admit it's just a bit awkward.)

Let's get back to the blocks. Thoses puppies can be used to reconstruct a carbonite freezing chamber _as well as_ hosting an epic cliff-side battle between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow.
