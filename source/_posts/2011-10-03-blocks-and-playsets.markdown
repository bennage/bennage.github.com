I've found recently that I favor blocks over playsets. If we're talking about toys, then of course the canonical example of blocks is Legos. You can build nearly anything with them. They are useful, vertasile, and inviting. 
Now, the term 'playset' might be a little more ambiguous. I don't mean the large outdoor sets with swings and sandboxes and spring-loaded horsies. No, I'm a child of the 80s and I loved me some Star Wars playsets.
