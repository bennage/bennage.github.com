I've recently discovered that I favor blocks over playsets. I'm talking about toys, and of course the canonical example of blocks is Legos. You can build nearly anything with them. They are useful, versatile, and inviting. 

Now, the term 'playset' warrants a bit more explanation. I don't mean the large outdoor sets with swings and sandboxes and spring-loaded horsies. No, I'm a child of the 80s and I _loved me some_ Star Wars playsets.

So my definition of 'playset' is colored by my childhood. I think think of 'playset' as a themed toy representing an environment. Like the Hoth playset pictured here. If you want to pretend you are the Imperials raining destruction upon a ragtag Rebel Alliance, the [Hoth Imperial Attack playset](http://www.ebay.com/csc/i.html?_nkw=Hoth+imperial+attack+playset&LH_Complete=1&_odkw=Hoth+attack+playset "Yes, I had this as a kid.") can't be beat.

The problem is _that's all you can do with it_. I mean, you can't use the Hoth playset to stage a Cybertronian battle between Optimus and Megatron. (Well you can, but you'll have admit it's just a bit awkward.)

Let's get back to the blocks. Those puppies can be used to reconstruct a carbonite freezing chamber _as well as_ hosting an epic cliff-side battle between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow.
