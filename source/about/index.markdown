I'm a Software Developer working at Microsoft.

I am interested in way too much, and suffer from a paralytic oscillation between science, philosophy, literature, math, history, and video games. That last bit is the worst when it comes to wasted time.

I am also keenly interested in my wife and my children. Finally, I follow Jesus.

	<p>"I've got it now", cried Bull, "it was because he was so fat and so light. Just like a balloon. We always think of fat people as heavy, but he could have danced against a sylph. I see now what I mean. Moderate strength is shown in violence, supreme strength is shown in levity. It was like the old speculations - what would happen if an elephant could leap up in the sky like a grasshopper?"</p>
